Many of the city’s best attractions (also, many hostels) are here too, such as the Botero Museum, the Gold Museum, and several churches and universities. Watch live music while hanging at Plaza Chorro de Quevedo, try the local chicha (a drink made from corn, often fermented to be alcoholic) on the side streets, and take in some of the amazing restaurants in this district.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://media.nomadicmatt.com/2019/bogotaitinerary14.jpg\" alt=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Santuario_Nacional_de_Nuestra_Se%C3%B1ora_del_Carmen.JPG\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>8.

Game the Loyalty Programs: Sign-up Bonuses</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your personal credit is good enough to get an average credit card, then don’t get an&nbsp;<em>average</em>&nbsp;credit card. Get one that will really reward you in a big way for your spending–starting with a good sign-up bonus. I once got four free international flights in the course of one year by playing this game, to destinations as far away as Chile and Thailand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For instance, you can go sign up for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/223/T1BJJCR7PU\">Southwest Airlines card</a>&nbsp;right now and spend $1,000 on it, you’ll get 40,000 points in their rewards program. That’s enough for a $400 plane ticket. You can go most anywhere in the USA for that, and often Mexico or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.luxurylatinamerica.com/belize.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Belize</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Assuming you’ve got good enough credit to apply for multiple cards, you can play several angles to cover the main costs of your vacation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A) Start with one airline card, preferably for the airline where you already have the most miles or the one you’re probably going to fly on the most over the next year or two. If you live somewhere with lots of competition and won’t use the card internationally, then just see who is offering a good sign-up incentive. Usually you’ll get between 30,000 and 60,000 miles. If you sign up for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/217/5LFBBVJ92X\">United Explorer Mileage Plus card</a>&nbsp;right now you can get 40,000 miles. You have to spend $2,000 on the card in 90 days, so plan on putting some big purchases on it (which also earn points). That many miles will get you to Canada, Mexico, or Central America just on the bonus—or across the USA.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then do it again for another airline to bank miles for different locations. Delta is offering a 60,000 mile sign-up bonus for their&nbsp;<a href=\"http://refer.amex.us/TIMOtLzVmG?xl=cpqa\">Gold Delta SkyMiles Card</a>. With all of these you can use the miles to book with their partner airlines, so those 60,000 miles can really open up the world. Following that referral link though; if you just pull it up on Google they’re only offering 30,000.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>B) Then get a credit card that’s tied to a specific hotel chain. You’ll usually get the best sign-up bonus from the IHG one (Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, Kimpton) from Chase or the Club Carlson (Radisson) one from US Bank. Right now the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\">IHG Rewards Club Premier card</a>&nbsp;gives you a sign-up bonus of 80,000 points after spending $2,000, Platinum status (free room upgrades) and a free night when you renew the card in a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you get the bonus, you’ll have several free hotel nights. Marriott is currently offering a 100,000 points deal, but it’s not apples to apples with hotel loyalty program points needed. In my experience, you’ll get more free nights with 80K from IHG than you will 100K from Marriott or Hyatt. As always though, a hotel chain you use a lot is going to make more sense than one you seldom stay with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>C) Get a credit card (or use one that you already have) that allows you to contribute miles to multiple programs and top off your accounts. American Express has the Membership Rewards program, but better bets these days are Chase Sapphire and Barclay Arrival Plus, which have a more useful array of programs and offer more bonus earning opportunites. Also, they don’t levy a foreign transaction fee, which some Amex cards still annoyingly do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With these cards you can transfer over just the points you need for a ticket, as I did last week with Delta to “buy” my wife a ticket to come with me to Montana later this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Game the Loyalty Systems 2: Leverage Your Spending</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have one or more of these cards, use them for as much of your spending as possible that you’re going to be able to pay off. Every dollar you spend each month on cable, internet, phone bills, gas, Uber/Lyft, or public transportation could be putting more points on your balance. Then there are all kinds of bonus earning opportunities from mileage malls, dining programs, and using the card for purchases at that airline or hotel chain.

If you get lots of perks from your card though, like upgraded status or free checked bags, it’s usually worth it to keep paying the annual fee and rack up miles from your spending. I have cards for four airlines. This way I avoid the bag fees that put me in a bad mood and I never purchase a flight without earning bonus miles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There may be spending discount promotions too.

I’ve gotten several Hilton rooms for 10,000 points.

Game the Loyalty Programs: Sign-up Bonuses</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your personal credit is good enough to get an average credit card, then don’t get an&nbsp;<em>average</em>&nbsp;credit card. Get one that will really reward you in a big way for your spending–starting with a good sign-up bonus. I once got four free international flights in the course of one year by playing this game, to destinations as far away as Chile and Thailand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For instance, you can go sign up for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/223/T1BJJCR7PU\">Southwest Airlines card</a>&nbsp;right now and spend $1,000 on it, you’ll get 40,000 points in their rewards program. That’s enough for a $400 plane ticket. You can go most anywhere in the USA for that, and often Mexico or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.luxurylatinamerica.com/belize.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Belize</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Assuming you’ve got good enough credit to apply for multiple cards, you can play several angles to cover the main costs of your vacation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A) Start with one airline card, preferably for the airline where you already have the most miles or the one you’re probably going to fly on the most over the next year or two. If you live somewhere with lots of competition and won’t use the card internationally, then just see who is offering a good sign-up incentive. Usually you’ll get between 30,000 and 60,000 miles. If you sign up for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/217/5LFBBVJ92X\">United Explorer Mileage Plus card</a>&nbsp;right now you can get 40,000 miles. You have to spend $2,000 on the card in 90 days, so plan on putting some big purchases on it (which also earn points). That many miles will get you to Canada, Mexico, or Central America just on the bonus—or across the USA.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then do it again for another airline to bank miles for different locations. Delta is offering a 60,000 mile sign-up bonus for their&nbsp;<a href=\"http://refer.amex.us/TIMOtLzVmG?xl=cpqa\">Gold Delta SkyMiles Card</a>. With all of these you can use the miles to book with their partner airlines, so those 60,000 miles can really open up the world. Following that referral link though; if you just pull it up on Google they’re only offering 30,000.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>B) Then get a credit card that’s tied to a specific hotel chain. You’ll usually get the best sign-up bonus from the IHG one (Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, Kimpton) from Chase or the Club Carlson (Radisson) one from US Bank. Right now the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\">IHG Rewards Club Premier card</a>&nbsp;gives you a sign-up bonus of 80,000 points after spending $2,000, Platinum status (free room upgrades) and a free night when you renew the card in a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13581,\"align\":\"center\",\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ihg-card-600.jpg\" alt=\"Earn free hotel nights\" class=\"wp-image-13581\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you get the bonus, you’ll have several free hotel nights. Marriott is currently offering a 100,000 points deal, but it’s not apples to apples with hotel loyalty program points needed. In my experience, you’ll get more free nights with 80K from IHG than you will 100K from Marriott or Hyatt. As always though, a hotel chain you use a lot is going to make more sense than one you seldom stay with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>C) Get a credit card (or use one that you already have) that allows you to contribute miles to multiple programs and top off your accounts. American Express has the Membership Rewards program, but better bets these days are Chase Sapphire and Barclay Arrival Plus, which have a more useful array of programs and offer more bonus earning opportunites. Also, they don’t levy a foreign transaction fee, which some Amex cards still annoyingly do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With these cards you can transfer over just the points you need for a ticket, as I did last week with Delta to “buy” my wife a ticket to come with me to Montana later this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Game the Loyalty Systems 2: Leverage Your Spending</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have one or more of these cards, use them for as much of your spending as possible that you’re going to be able to pay off. Every dollar you spend each month on cable, internet, phone bills, gas, Uber/Lyft, or public transportation could be putting more points on your balance. Then there are all kinds of bonus earning opportunities from mileage malls, dining programs, and using the card for purchases at that airline or hotel chain. Add up what you spend in a typical year that you could put on a card and it’s probably enough to earn another flight or couple hotel nights.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some people get rid of a card after a year or two because they mainly got it for the sign-up bonus. If you get lots of perks from your card though, like upgraded status or free checked bags, it’s usually worth it to keep paying the annual fee and rack up miles from your spending. I have cards for four airlines. This way I avoid the bag fees that put me in a bad mood and I never purchase a flight without earning bonus miles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There may be spending discount promotions too. In three different countries I’ve gotten a night at a Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express where I wanted to go for just 5,000 points because the place was one their “points breaks” listings at a huge discount. I’ve gotten several Hilton rooms for 10,000 points. I once flew from Mexico to Peru and back for just 20,000 airline miles on United (actually flying on Avianca) because of a discounted miles promotion they were running for United Chase credit card holders.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3.

Game the Loyalty Programs: Sign-up Bonuses</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your personal credit is good enough to get an average credit card, then don’t get an&nbsp;<em>average</em>&nbsp;credit card. Get one that will really reward you in a big way for your spending–starting with a good sign-up bonus. I once got four free international flights in the course of one year by playing this game, to destinations as far away as Chile and Thailand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For instance, you can go sign up for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/223/T1BJJCR7PU\">Southwest Airlines card</a>&nbsp;right now and spend $1,000 on it, you’ll get 40,000 points in their rewards program. That’s enough for a $400 plane ticket. You can go most anywhere in the USA for that, and often Mexico or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.luxurylatinamerica.com/belize.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Belize</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Assuming you’ve got good enough credit to apply for multiple cards, you can play several angles to cover the main costs of your vacation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A) Start with one airline card, preferably for the airline where you already have the most miles or the one you’re probably going to fly on the most over the next year or two. If you live somewhere with lots of competition and won’t use the card internationally, then just see who is offering a good sign-up incentive. Usually you’ll get between 30,000 and 60,000 miles. If you sign up for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/217/5LFBBVJ92X\">United Explorer Mileage Plus card</a>&nbsp;right now you can get 40,000 miles. You have to spend $2,000 on the card in 90 days, so plan on putting some big purchases on it (which also earn points). That many miles will get you to Canada, Mexico, or Central America just on the bonus—or across the USA.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then do it again for another airline to bank miles for different locations. Delta is offering a 60,000 mile sign-up bonus for their&nbsp;<a href=\"http://refer.amex.us/TIMOtLzVmG?xl=cpqa\">Gold Delta SkyMiles Card</a>. With all of these you can use the miles to book with their partner airlines, so those 60,000 miles can really open up the world. Following that referral link though; if you just pull it up on Google they’re only offering 30,000.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>B) Then get a credit card that’s tied to a specific hotel chain. You’ll usually get the best sign-up bonus from the IHG one (Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, Kimpton) from Chase or the Club Carlson (Radisson) one from US Bank. Right now the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\">IHG Rewards Club Premier card</a>&nbsp;gives you a sign-up bonus of 80,000 points after spending $2,000, Platinum status (free room upgrades) and a free night when you renew the card in a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13581,\"align\":\"center\",\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ihg-card-600.jpg\" alt=\"Earn free hotel nights\" class=\"wp-image-13581\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you get the bonus, you’ll have several free hotel nights. Marriott is currently offering a 100,000 points deal, but it’s not apples to apples with hotel loyalty program points needed. In my experience, you’ll get more free nights with 80K from IHG than you will 100K from Marriott or Hyatt. As always though, a hotel chain you use a lot is going to make more sense than one you seldom stay with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>C) Get a credit card (or use one that you already have) that allows you to contribute miles to multiple programs and top off your accounts. American Express has the Membership Rewards program, but better bets these days are Chase Sapphire and Barclay Arrival Plus, which have a more useful array of programs and offer more bonus earning opportunites. Also, they don’t levy a foreign transaction fee, which some Amex cards still annoyingly do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With these cards you can transfer over just the points you need for a ticket, as I did last week with Delta to “buy” my wife a ticket to come with me to Montana later this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Game the Loyalty Systems 2: Leverage Your Spending</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have one or more of these cards, use them for as much of your spending as possible that you’re going to be able to pay off. Every dollar you spend each month on cable, internet, phone bills, gas, Uber/Lyft, or public transportation could be putting more points on your balance. Then there are all kinds of bonus earning opportunities from mileage malls, dining programs, and using the card for purchases at that airline or hotel chain. Add up what you spend in a typical year that you could put on a card and it’s probably enough to earn another flight or couple hotel nights.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some people get rid of a card after a year or two because they mainly got it for the sign-up bonus. If you get lots of perks from your card though, like upgraded status or free checked bags, it’s usually worth it to keep paying the annual fee and rack up miles from your spending. I have cards for four airlines. This way I avoid the bag fees that put me in a bad mood and I never purchase a flight without earning bonus miles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There may be spending discount promotions too. In three different countries I’ve gotten a night at a Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express where I wanted to go for just 5,000 points because the place was one their “points breaks” listings at a huge discount. I’ve gotten several Hilton rooms for 10,000 points. I once flew from Mexico to Peru and back for just 20,000 airline miles on United (actually flying on Avianca) because of a discounted miles promotion they were running for United Chase credit card holders.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3. Be Spontaneous With Your Travel</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes taking advantage of these great deals means doing things in the opposite order of most people. Instead of deciding where to go and then figuring out how to jam that place into your budget, save the destination choice for last. If you can use miles and hotel points in Place D but not in A, B, or C, then go directly to D!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or use a site that specializes in last-minute deals and just see what pops up. Examples in all budget ranges include LuxuryLink, Groupon, Jetsetter, Hotwire,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1222312-11938424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CheapCaribbean.com</a>, and now most of the big online travel agents like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1222312-10393000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Priceline</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or throw it wide open: go to Google Flights, put in your home airport, and see what comes up. If you’re thinking you can’t get a summer vacation deal from NYC, think again. You just need to be flexible. Granted, I only found one flight under $600 to Europe then (Madrid), but there are plenty of deals in this hemisphere in mid-June for a week:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13582,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-flights-summer.jpg\" alt=\"Find the best vacation flight deals from your own airport\" class=\"wp-image-13582\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go check from your own city, but here are the round-trip price highlights from that screen shot above: Atlanta $135, Miami $207, Mexico City $309. If I could fit it on here, you’d see some South America destinations for less than $500 and some Canadian ones less than $200.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can do something similar with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1222312-12532523\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Skyscanner</a>&nbsp;app or website, just putting in your home airport and picking “anywhere” for the destination. Haven’t heard of the place before? So what. You can learn most everything you need to know about it in one day online, or just buy a guidebook right before you take off and read it on the plane. You’ll probably have a better time than you did on any previous long-planned vacation because there were fun surprises.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don’t forget about regional flight options either. You can pick up some surprisingly cheap flights within Asia or Europe, or with one of the many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/2017/01/25/the-budget-airlines-of-mexico/\">Mexican airlines</a>. There are great deals in the USA with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/2017/01/30/flying-on-allegiant-air-without-baggage-fees-take-2/\">Allegiant</a>&nbsp;if you’re traveling light.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>4. Extend Business Trips</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many people travel hours away from their home city, then don’t see much beyond a hotel, offices, or a convention center. This is a big missed opportunity. Make it a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bonwi.com/traveling-for-business-or-pleasure-why-not-both/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bleisure trip</a>instead.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I worked in a corporate job, here are just a few places I traveled on my own over a long weekend: Montreal, Austin, San Francisco, D.C., Dallas, San Jose, Boston, Las Vegas… In all these cases, there was some biz meeting or convention I had to go to, but I always booked my flight back a few days later whenever possible. As long as the price was the same or less (it usually was because I stayed over a Saturday), then they couldn’t have cared less. All I had to pay for was a couple days of local expenses. Could you do the same but you just don’t?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I travel through airports on Fridays, they’re always packed wall to wall with people in business clothing coming home from their work on the road. A lot of them have families with kids I’m sure and need to get back for the soccer match or swim meet.

Game the Loyalty Programs: Sign-up Bonuses</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your personal credit is good enough to get an average credit card, then don’t get an&nbsp;<em>average</em>&nbsp;credit card. Get one that will really reward you in a big way for your spending–starting with a good sign-up bonus. I once got four free international flights in the course of one year by playing this game, to destinations as far away as Chile and Thailand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For instance, you can go sign up for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/223/T1BJJCR7PU\">Southwest Airlines card</a>&nbsp;right now and spend $1,000 on it, you’ll get 40,000 points in their rewards program. That’s enough for a $400 plane ticket. You can go most anywhere in the USA for that, and often Mexico or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.luxurylatinamerica.com/belize.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Belize</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Assuming you’ve got good enough credit to apply for multiple cards, you can play several angles to cover the main costs of your vacation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A) Start with one airline card, preferably for the airline where you already have the most miles or the one you’re probably going to fly on the most over the next year or two. If you live somewhere with lots of competition and won’t use the card internationally, then just see who is offering a good sign-up incentive. Usually you’ll get between 30,000 and 60,000 miles. If you sign up for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/217/5LFBBVJ92X\">United Explorer Mileage Plus card</a>&nbsp;right now you can get 40,000 miles. You have to spend $2,000 on the card in 90 days, so plan on putting some big purchases on it (which also earn points). That many miles will get you to Canada, Mexico, or Central America just on the bonus—or across the USA.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then do it again for another airline to bank miles for different locations. Delta is offering a 60,000 mile sign-up bonus for their&nbsp;<a href=\"http://refer.amex.us/TIMOtLzVmG?xl=cpqa\">Gold Delta SkyMiles Card</a>. With all of these you can use the miles to book with their partner airlines, so those 60,000 miles can really open up the world. Following that referral link though; if you just pull it up on Google they’re only offering 30,000.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>B) Then get a credit card that’s tied to a specific hotel chain. You’ll usually get the best sign-up bonus from the IHG one (Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, Kimpton) from Chase or the Club Carlson (Radisson) one from US Bank. Right now the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\">IHG Rewards Club Premier card</a>&nbsp;gives you a sign-up bonus of 80,000 points after spending $2,000, Platinum status (free room upgrades) and a free night when you renew the card in a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13581,\"align\":\"center\",\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ihg-card-600.jpg\" alt=\"Earn free hotel nights\" class=\"wp-image-13581\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you get the bonus, you’ll have several free hotel nights. Marriott is currently offering a 100,000 points deal, but it’s not apples to apples with hotel loyalty program points needed. In my experience, you’ll get more free nights with 80K from IHG than you will 100K from Marriott or Hyatt. As always though, a hotel chain you use a lot is going to make more sense than one you seldom stay with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>C) Get a credit card (or use one that you already have) that allows you to contribute miles to multiple programs and top off your accounts. American Express has the Membership Rewards program, but better bets these days are Chase Sapphire and Barclay Arrival Plus, which have a more useful array of programs and offer more bonus earning opportunites. Also, they don’t levy a foreign transaction fee, which some Amex cards still annoyingly do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With these cards you can transfer over just the points you need for a ticket, as I did last week with Delta to “buy” my wife a ticket to come with me to Montana later this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Game the Loyalty Systems 2: Leverage Your Spending</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have one or more of these cards, use them for as much of your spending as possible that you’re going to be able to pay off. Every dollar you spend each month on cable, internet, phone bills, gas, Uber/Lyft, or public transportation could be putting more points on your balance. Then there are all kinds of bonus earning opportunities from mileage malls, dining programs, and using the card for purchases at that airline or hotel chain. Add up what you spend in a typical year that you could put on a card and it’s probably enough to earn another flight or couple hotel nights.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some people get rid of a card after a year or two because they mainly got it for the sign-up bonus. If you get lots of perks from your card though, like upgraded status or free checked bags, it’s usually worth it to keep paying the annual fee and rack up miles from your spending. I have cards for four airlines. This way I avoid the bag fees that put me in a bad mood and I never purchase a flight without earning bonus miles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There may be spending discount promotions too. In three different countries I’ve gotten a night at a Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express where I wanted to go for just 5,000 points because the place was one their “points breaks” listings at a huge discount. I’ve gotten several Hilton rooms for 10,000 points. I once flew from Mexico to Peru and back for just 20,000 airline miles on United (actually flying on Avianca) because of a discounted miles promotion they were running for United Chase credit card holders.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3. Be Spontaneous With Your Travel</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes taking advantage of these great deals means doing things in the opposite order of most people. Instead of deciding where to go and then figuring out how to jam that place into your budget, save the destination choice for last. If you can use miles and hotel points in Place D but not in A, B, or C, then go directly to D!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or use a site that specializes in last-minute deals and just see what pops up. Examples in all budget ranges include LuxuryLink, Groupon, Jetsetter, Hotwire,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1222312-11938424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CheapCaribbean.com</a>, and now most of the big online travel agents like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1222312-10393000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Priceline</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or throw it wide open: go to Google Flights, put in your home airport, and see what comes up. If you’re thinking you can’t get a summer vacation deal from NYC, think again. You just need to be flexible. Granted, I only found one flight under $600 to Europe then (Madrid), but there are plenty of deals in this hemisphere in mid-June for a week:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13582,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-flights-summer.jpg\" alt=\"Find the best vacation flight deals from your own airport\" class=\"wp-image-13582\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go check from your own city, but here are the round-trip price highlights from that screen shot above: Atlanta $135, Miami $207, Mexico City $309. If I could fit it on here, you’d see some South America destinations for less than $500 and some Canadian ones less than $200.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can do something similar with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1222312-12532523\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Skyscanner</a>&nbsp;app or website, just putting in your home airport and picking “anywhere” for the destination. Haven’t heard of the place before? So what. You can learn most everything you need to know about it in one day online, or just buy a guidebook right before you take off and read it on the plane. You’ll probably have a better time than you did on any previous long-planned vacation because there were fun surprises.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don’t forget about regional flight options either. You can pick up some surprisingly cheap flights within Asia or Europe, or with one of the many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/2017/01/25/the-budget-airlines-of-mexico/\">Mexican airlines</a>. There are great deals in the USA with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/2017/01/30/flying-on-allegiant-air-without-baggage-fees-take-2/\">Allegiant</a>&nbsp;if you’re traveling light.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>4. Extend Business Trips</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many people travel hours away from their home city, then don’t see much beyond a hotel, offices, or a convention center. This is a big missed opportunity. Make it a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bonwi.com/traveling-for-business-or-pleasure-why-not-both/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bleisure trip</a>instead.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I worked in a corporate job, here are just a few places I traveled on my own over a long weekend: Montreal, Austin, San Francisco, D.C., Dallas, San Jose, Boston, Las Vegas… In all these cases, there was some biz meeting or convention I had to go to, but I always booked my flight back a few days later whenever possible. As long as the price was the same or less (it usually was because I stayed over a Saturday), then they couldn’t have cared less. All I had to pay for was a couple days of local expenses. Could you do the same but you just don’t?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I travel through airports on Fridays, they’re always packed wall to wall with people in business clothing coming home from their work on the road. A lot of them have families with kids I’m sure and need to get back for the soccer match or swim meet. But if you don’t, what’s your hurry?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13583} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/saint-augustine-top-600x385.jpg\" alt=\"St. Augustine from Orlando \" class=\"wp-image-13583\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>A couple hours from Orlando…</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sure, Orlando might not be your scene, but you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bonwi.com/5-best-florida-beaches-easily-reached-orlando/\">reach beaches on either coast</a>&nbsp;in a rental care in two hours.

Game the Loyalty Programs: Sign-up Bonuses</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your personal credit is good enough to get an average credit card, then don’t get an&nbsp;<em>average</em>&nbsp;credit card. Get one that will really reward you in a big way for your spending–starting with a good sign-up bonus. I once got four free international flights in the course of one year by playing this game, to destinations as far away as Chile and Thailand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For instance, you can go sign up for a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/223/T1BJJCR7PU\">Southwest Airlines card</a>&nbsp;right now and spend $1,000 on it, you’ll get 40,000 points in their rewards program. That’s enough for a $400 plane ticket. You can go most anywhere in the USA for that, and often Mexico or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.luxurylatinamerica.com/belize.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Belize</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Assuming you’ve got good enough credit to apply for multiple cards, you can play several angles to cover the main costs of your vacation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A) Start with one airline card, preferably for the airline where you already have the most miles or the one you’re probably going to fly on the most over the next year or two. If you live somewhere with lots of competition and won’t use the card internationally, then just see who is offering a good sign-up incentive. Usually you’ll get between 30,000 and 60,000 miles. If you sign up for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/217/5LFBBVJ92X\">United Explorer Mileage Plus card</a>&nbsp;right now you can get 40,000 miles. You have to spend $2,000 on the card in 90 days, so plan on putting some big purchases on it (which also earn points). That many miles will get you to Canada, Mexico, or Central America just on the bonus—or across the USA.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then do it again for another airline to bank miles for different locations. Delta is offering a 60,000 mile sign-up bonus for their&nbsp;<a href=\"http://refer.amex.us/TIMOtLzVmG?xl=cpqa\">Gold Delta SkyMiles Card</a>. With all of these you can use the miles to book with their partner airlines, so those 60,000 miles can really open up the world. Following that referral link though; if you just pull it up on Google they’re only offering 30,000.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>B) Then get a credit card that’s tied to a specific hotel chain. You’ll usually get the best sign-up bonus from the IHG one (Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, Kimpton) from Chase or the Club Carlson (Radisson) one from US Bank. Right now the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\">IHG Rewards Club Premier card</a>&nbsp;gives you a sign-up bonus of 80,000 points after spending $2,000, Platinum status (free room upgrades) and a free night when you renew the card in a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13581,\"align\":\"center\",\"linkDestination\":\"custom\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ihg-card-600.jpg\" alt=\"Earn free hotel nights\" class=\"wp-image-13581\"/></a></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you get the bonus, you’ll have several free hotel nights. Marriott is currently offering a 100,000 points deal, but it’s not apples to apples with hotel loyalty program points needed. In my experience, you’ll get more free nights with 80K from IHG than you will 100K from Marriott or Hyatt. As always though, a hotel chain you use a lot is going to make more sense than one you seldom stay with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>C) Get a credit card (or use one that you already have) that allows you to contribute miles to multiple programs and top off your accounts. American Express has the Membership Rewards program, but better bets these days are Chase Sapphire and Barclay Arrival Plus, which have a more useful array of programs and offer more bonus earning opportunites. Also, they don’t levy a foreign transaction fee, which some Amex cards still annoyingly do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With these cards you can transfer over just the points you need for a ticket, as I did last week with Delta to “buy” my wife a ticket to come with me to Montana later this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Game the Loyalty Systems 2: Leverage Your Spending</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have one or more of these cards, use them for as much of your spending as possible that you’re going to be able to pay off. Every dollar you spend each month on cable, internet, phone bills, gas, Uber/Lyft, or public transportation could be putting more points on your balance. Then there are all kinds of bonus earning opportunities from mileage malls, dining programs, and using the card for purchases at that airline or hotel chain. Add up what you spend in a typical year that you could put on a card and it’s probably enough to earn another flight or couple hotel nights.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some people get rid of a card after a year or two because they mainly got it for the sign-up bonus. If you get lots of perks from your card though, like upgraded status or free checked bags, it’s usually worth it to keep paying the annual fee and rack up miles from your spending. I have cards for four airlines. This way I avoid the bag fees that put me in a bad mood and I never purchase a flight without earning bonus miles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There may be spending discount promotions too. In three different countries I’ve gotten a night at a Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express where I wanted to go for just 5,000 points because the place was one their “points breaks” listings at a huge discount. I’ve gotten several Hilton rooms for 10,000 points. I once flew from Mexico to Peru and back for just 20,000 airline miles on United (actually flying on Avianca) because of a discounted miles promotion they were running for United Chase credit card holders.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3. Be Spontaneous With Your Travel</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes taking advantage of these great deals means doing things in the opposite order of most people. Instead of deciding where to go and then figuring out how to jam that place into your budget, save the destination choice for last. If you can use miles and hotel points in Place D but not in A, B, or C, then go directly to D!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or use a site that specializes in last-minute deals and just see what pops up. Examples in all budget ranges include LuxuryLink, Groupon, Jetsetter, Hotwire,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1222312-11938424\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CheapCaribbean.com</a>, and now most of the big online travel agents like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-1222312-10393000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Priceline</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or throw it wide open: go to Google Flights, put in your home airport, and see what comes up. If you’re thinking you can’t get a summer vacation deal from NYC, think again. You just need to be flexible. Granted, I only found one flight under $600 to Europe then (Madrid), but there are plenty of deals in this hemisphere in mid-June for a week:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13582,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-flights-summer.jpg\" alt=\"Find the best vacation flight deals from your own airport\" class=\"wp-image-13582\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go check from your own city, but here are the round-trip price highlights from that screen shot above: Atlanta $135, Miami $207, Mexico City $309. If I could fit it on here, you’d see some South America destinations for less than $500 and some Canadian ones less than $200.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can do something similar with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-1222312-12532523\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Skyscanner</a>&nbsp;app or website, just putting in your home airport and picking “anywhere” for the destination. Haven’t heard of the place before? So what. You can learn most everything you need to know about it in one day online, or just buy a guidebook right before you take off and read it on the plane. You’ll probably have a better time than you did on any previous long-planned vacation because there were fun surprises.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don’t forget about regional flight options either. You can pick up some surprisingly cheap flights within Asia or Europe, or with one of the many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/2017/01/25/the-budget-airlines-of-mexico/\">Mexican airlines</a>.

Extend Business Trips</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many people travel hours away from their home city, then don’t see much beyond a hotel, offices, or a convention center. This is a big missed opportunity.

As long as the price was the same or less (it usually was because I stayed over a Saturday), then they couldn’t have cared less. All I had to pay for was a couple days of local expenses. Could you do the same but you just don’t?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I travel through airports on Fridays, they’re always packed wall to wall with people in business clothing coming home from their work on the road. A lot of them have families with kids I’m sure and need to get back for the soccer match or swim meet. But if you don’t, what’s your hurry?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13583} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/saint-augustine-top-600x385.jpg\" alt=\"St. Augustine from Orlando \" class=\"wp-image-13583\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>A couple hours from Orlando…</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sure, Orlando might not be your scene, but you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.bonwi.com/5-best-florida-beaches-easily-reached-orlando/\">reach beaches on either coast</a>&nbsp;in a rental care in two hours.

If you get lots of perks from your card though, like upgraded status or free checked bags, it’s usually worth it to keep paying the annual fee and rack up miles from your spending. I have cards for four airlines. This way I avoid the bag fees that put me in a bad mood and I never purchase a flight without earning bonus miles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There may be spending discount promotions too. In three different countries I’ve gotten a night at a Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express where I wanted to go for just 5,000 points because the place was one their “points breaks” listings at a huge discount. I’ve gotten several Hilton rooms for 10,000 points. I once flew from Mexico to Peru and back for just 20,000 airline miles on United (actually flying on Avianca) because of a discounted miles promotion they were running for United Chase credit card holders.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3. Be Spontaneous With Your Travel</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes taking advantage of these great deals means doing things in the opposite order of most people. Instead of deciding where to go and then figuring out how to jam that place into your budget, save the destination choice for last. If you can use miles and hotel points in Place D but not in A, B, or C, then go directly to D!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or use a site that specializes in last-minute deals and just see what pops up.

If you’re thinking you can’t get a summer vacation deal from NYC, think again. You just need to be flexible.

For instance, some translators may only give literal translations. Others may translate idioms and colloquial phrases accurately. This is important to note because you may want to say something that doesn’t have a natural translation in Korean. For example, of you look up “a piece of cake,” then a literal translation will pull up 케이크 조각 (<em>keikeu jogag</em>), which means “cake piece.” What you actually wanted to say was “it was easy,” and that’s 식은 죽 먹기 (<em>sig-eun jug meoggi</em>) which in Korean is the idiom “like eating cold porridge.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need to ask yourself: are you translating from speech or text most?

And then you use it to help you create the whole sentence for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This “translator trap” is a major pitfall for language learners. It takes away the mental stimulation of&nbsp;<em>trying to remember the language on your own</em>.

Are you learning Korean to travel to Korea? Or are you trying to get a deeper knowledge of the language for reading books? Is your primary goal to consume Korean media, or talk to locals?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every translator app is different, and they usually focus on one aspect over another. For instance, some translators may only give literal translations. Others may translate idioms and colloquial phrases accurately. This is important to note because you may want to say something that doesn’t have a natural translation in Korean. For example, of you look up “a piece of cake,” then a literal translation will pull up 케이크 조각 (<em>keikeu jogag</em>), which means “cake piece.” What you actually wanted to say was “it was easy,” and that’s 식은 죽 먹기 (<em>sig-eun jug meoggi</em>) which in Korean is the idiom “like eating cold porridge.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need to ask yourself: are you translating from speech or text most? Are you looking for something that needs some basic knowledge of Korean to make it useful? Or are you a beginner and need something that simplifies it – even helping you read&nbsp;<em>Hangul</em>, the Korean script?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you decide how you’ll be using the app, you can find one that meets your needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"onemajorcaveatavoidtranslatorappdependence\">One Major Caveat: Avoid Translator App Dependence!</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sure, Korean translator apps can be super helpful if you use them right.

At first, you’re only looking up words you don’t know to help you flesh out a sentence. But then you’re using it to check the accuracy of your whole sentence. And then you use it to help you create the whole sentence for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This “translator trap” is a major pitfall for language learners. It takes away the mental stimulation of&nbsp;<em>trying to remember the language on your own</em>. If you become this reliant on translators, then you may be better deleting them from your phone and sticking with a real-life dictionary — yes, I mean a physical book. If you really want to know something, you’ll have to put in the effort to flip through the book and find it. And it won’t always be handy.

One thing you’ll notice when hearing this form used in Spanish? The speakers use future tense for the more distant future. In English, the near future is still expressed with future tense, but that’s not the case here. In Spanish, there’s a different verb tense for the near future, but you can use present tense, too. So, just know that you won’t use this tense as much as you do in English.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'Spanish Verb Conjugations: How to Master the 3 Most Important Verb Tenses', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '205-revision-v1', '', '', '2019-04-19 21:38:45', '2019-04-19 21:38:45', '', 205, 'http://localhost/wordpress/2019/04/19/205-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

My goal is to always find dog-friendly vacations in the Pacific Northwest so they can come with me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My rescue dogs, a Border Collie mix and a German Shepherd mix, aren’t exactly small, so it’s not easy to take them everywhere I go.

Because the course not only teaches the Korean language, but also a variety of methods that are proven to help Korean learners pick up the language. The course also walks you through memorization techniques so that the words you learn in the course stick with you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"myexperienceusing90daykoreanthegood\">My Experience Using 90 Day Korean: The Good</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I started&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>, one thing immediately stood out: the way the course material is written. It’s engaging, well-paced, and best of all, it’s written with a sense of humor. It’s far from dry or boring. The author(s) also weave storytelling into the course, using it to make the grammar and vocabulary you’re learning more relatable and fun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This helped me get acquainted with an important part of the Korean language. You see, one of the things that I picked up on when learning both Japanese and Korean is that verb endings are important. Basically, the ending you attach to the verb completely changes its meaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, in Korean, 하다 means “to do”. If I want to say “I do”, I would change it to 해요. From there:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>하고 싶어요 – “want to do”</li><li>해 보세요 – “try to do”</li><li>할 수 있어요 – “could do”</li><li>할 수 없어요 – “couldn’t do”</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These endings are key to learning to speak the language, but the first time I tried to learn Korean, I had a hard time finding all the most common verb endings in one place.&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;turned out to be that place.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In working through&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>, I finally had the chance to see all of these different endings in action, read well-written explanations, and do guided practice. It was exactly what I had been looking for in a Korean language resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each of these verb forms are introduced to you gradually as you progress through the course. And despite learning so much useful Korean grammar, the course doesn’t&nbsp;<em>feel</em>grammar intensive. Often, the grammar is masked as a culture lesson, such as when you’re taught to use formal vs informal Korean. At other times, it’s surrounded by lessons focused on vocabulary and other information so you don’t feel as though you’re learning grammar point after grammar point. The lessons are really well organized.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;has several extra features on top of the core course. This includes the option to take notes and store them directly in the course. Personally, I still prefer to take notes by hand. It helps with memory and it’s a pretty rewarding way to see everything you’ve worked on, but it’s still nice to have the option to quickly jot things down and save them for later all in one place.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":25473,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/90-day-korean-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25473\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You learn a lot of material in&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>, but as I said before, it’s organized in a way that doesn’t feel overwhelming. It also builds naturally, so everything you learn spans out from what you’ve already studied in earlier lessons.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I started&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;a little bit after I began learning Korean for a second time, so I didn’t have a lot of experience with the language.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I dedicated myself to working through the course at a slightly faster pace than what is recommended. When you sign up for the course, you are sent a new mini module each week, but if you want to work through it a little faster, they have instructions within the course about how to contact them to get “advance access” to the course materials. I took advantage of this and in total, it took me about 4 to 5 months to work through everything at an “accelerated” pace. That said, I still want to go back and spend more time with some of the lessons to make sure I really get the most out of the lesson materials.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you work through the course, you can mark what you’ve gone through as complete.

It’s not hard to wonder: “do I really need to know all of this?”&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>seeks to eliminate this feeling by eliminating the material you probably don’t need. That way, when you study, you can focus all of your attention on what’s given to you rather than allow yourself to get distracted by that lingering question in the back of your mind.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"myexperienceusing90daykoreanwhatcouldbebetter\">My Experience Using 90 Day Korean: What Could Be Better?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each of the lessons in&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;have fun titles, but when you’re working through the course in a non-linear way, this isn’t very user-friendly. For example, after completing the course, there were a couple of lessons that I wanted to go over again, but because the titles didn’t always tell me what the lesson includes, I had a difficult time finding the particular lessons I was looking for later on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While you&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;access the course from the&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;app, it isn’t an app version of the course.

The experience is a little different than what you might expect within an app and I found it somewhat distracting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, I found that the search function within the course didn’t really work. On a couple different occasions, I tried to find lessons using the search function, even once pasting in the exact text I had copied from a lesson.

Is your primary goal to consume Korean media, or talk to locals?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every translator app is different, and they usually focus on one aspect over another. For instance, some translators may only give literal translations. Others may translate idioms and colloquial phrases accurately. This is important to note because you may want to say something that doesn’t have a natural translation in Korean. For example, of you look up “a piece of cake,” then a literal translation will pull up 케이크 조각 (<em>keikeu jogag</em>), which means “cake piece.” What you actually wanted to say was “it was easy,” and that’s 식은 죽 먹기 (<em>sig-eun jug meoggi</em>) which in Korean is the idiom “like eating cold porridge.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need to ask yourself: are you translating from speech or text most?

And then you use it to help you create the whole sentence for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This “translator trap” is a major pitfall for language learners. It takes away the mental stimulation of&nbsp;<em>trying to remember the language on your own</em>.

You can go most anywhere in the USA for that, and often Mexico or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.luxurylatinamerica.com/belize.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Belize</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Assuming you’ve got good enough credit to apply for multiple cards, you can play several angles to cover the main costs of your vacation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A) Start with one airline card, preferably for the airline where you already have the most miles or the one you’re probably going to fly on the most over the next year or two. If you live somewhere with lots of competition and won’t use the card internationally, then just see who is offering a good sign-up incentive. Usually you’ll get between 30,000 and 60,000 miles. If you sign up for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/217/5LFBBVJ92X\">United Explorer Mileage Plus card</a>&nbsp;right now you can get 40,000 miles. You have to spend $2,000 on the card in 90 days, so plan on putting some big purchases on it (which also earn points). That many miles will get you to Canada, Mexico, or Central America just on the bonus—or across the USA.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then do it again for another airline to bank miles for different locations. Delta is offering a 60,000 mile sign-up bonus for their&nbsp;<a href=\"http://refer.amex.us/TIMOtLzVmG?xl=cpqa\">Gold Delta SkyMiles Card</a>. With all of these you can use the miles to book with their partner airlines, so those 60,000 miles can really open up the world. Following that referral link though; if you just pull it up on Google they’re only offering 30,000.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>B) Then get a credit card that’s tied to a specific hotel chain. You’ll usually get the best sign-up bonus from the IHG one (Intercontinental, Holiday Inn, Kimpton) from Chase or the Club Carlson (Radisson) one from US Bank. Right now the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/251/VGRJUWTOTN\">IHG Rewards Club Premier card</a>&nbsp;gives you a sign-up bonus of 80,000 points after spending $2,000, Platinum status (free room upgrades) and a free night when you renew the card in a year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After you get the bonus, you’ll have several free hotel nights. Marriott is currently offering a 100,000 points deal, but it’s not apples to apples with hotel loyalty program points needed. In my experience, you’ll get more free nights with 80K from IHG than you will 100K from Marriott or Hyatt. As always though, a hotel chain you use a lot is going to make more sense than one you seldom stay with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>C) Get a credit card (or use one that you already have) that allows you to contribute miles to multiple programs and top off your accounts. American Express has the Membership Rewards program, but better bets these days are Chase Sapphire and Barclay Arrival Plus, which have a more useful array of programs and offer more bonus earning opportunites. Also, they don’t levy a foreign transaction fee, which some Amex cards still annoyingly do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With these cards you can transfer over just the points you need for a ticket, as I did last week with Delta to “buy” my wife a ticket to come with me to Montana later this year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>2. Game the Loyalty Systems 2: Leverage Your Spending</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have one or more of these cards, use them for as much of your spending as possible that you’re going to be able to pay off. Every dollar you spend each month on cable, internet, phone bills, gas, Uber/Lyft, or public transportation could be putting more points on your balance. Then there are all kinds of bonus earning opportunities from mileage malls, dining programs, and using the card for purchases at that airline or hotel chain. Add up what you spend in a typical year that you could put on a card and it’s probably enough to earn another flight or couple hotel nights.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some people get rid of a card after a year or two because they mainly got it for the sign-up bonus. If you get lots of perks from your card though, like upgraded status or free checked bags, it’s usually worth it to keep paying the annual fee and rack up miles from your spending. I have cards for four airlines. This way I avoid the bag fees that put me in a bad mood and I never purchase a flight without earning bonus miles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There may be spending discount promotions too. In three different countries I’ve gotten a night at a Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express where I wanted to go for just 5,000 points because the place was one their “points breaks” listings at a huge discount. I’ve gotten several Hilton rooms for 10,000 points. I once flew from Mexico to Peru and back for just 20,000 airline miles on United (actually flying on Avianca) because of a discounted miles promotion they were running for United Chase credit card holders.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3. Be Spontaneous With Your Travel</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes taking advantage of these great deals means doing things in the opposite order of most people. Instead of deciding where to go and then figuring out how to jam that place into your budget, save the destination choice for last. If you can use miles and hotel points in Place D but not in A, B, or C, then go directly to D!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or use a site that specializes in last-minute deals and just see what pops up. Examples in all budget ranges include LuxuryLink, Groupon, Jetsetter, Hotwire, CheapCaribbean.com, and now most of the big online travel agents like Priceline.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or throw it wide open: go to Google Flights, put in your home airport, and see what comes up. If you’re thinking you can’t get a summer vacation deal from NYC, think again. You just need to be flexible. Granted, I only found one flight under $600 to Europe then (Madrid), but there are plenty of deals in this hemisphere in mid-June for a week:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":13582,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.cheapestdestinationsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/google-flights-summer.jpg\" alt=\"Find the best vacation flight deals from your own airport\" class=\"wp-image-13582\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Go check from your own city, but here are the round-trip price highlights from that screen shot above: Atlanta $135, Miami $207, Mexico City $309.

Haven’t heard of the place before? So what. You can learn most everything you need to know about it in one day online, or just buy a guidebook right before you take off and read it on the plane.

I once flew from Mexico to Peru and back for just 20,000 airline miles on United (actually flying on Avianca) because of a discounted miles promotion they were running for United Chase credit card holders.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>3.

Choosing the right one for you is key.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"whattolookforinakoreantranslatorapp\">What to Look for in a Korean Translator App</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, you’ll want to take the time to test a few and see if they meet your needs. Are you learning Korean to travel to Korea? Or are you trying to get a deeper knowledge of the language for reading books? Is your primary goal to consume Korean media, or talk to locals?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every translator app is different, and they usually focus on one aspect over another. For instance, some translators may only give literal translations. Others may translate idioms and colloquial phrases accurately. This is important to note because you may want to say something that doesn’t have a natural translation in Korean. For example, of you look up “a piece of cake,” then a literal translation will pull up 케이크 조각 (<em>keikeu jogag</em>), which means “cake piece.” What you actually wanted to say was “it was easy,” and that’s 식은 죽 먹기 (<em>sig-eun jug meoggi</em>) which in Korean is the idiom “like eating cold porridge.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You need to ask yourself: are you translating from speech or text most? Are you looking for something that needs some basic knowledge of Korean to make it useful? Or are you a beginner and need something that simplifies it – even helping you read&nbsp;<em>Hangul</em>, the Korean script?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you decide how you’ll be using the app, you can find one that meets your needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"onemajorcaveatavoidtranslatorappdependence\">One Major Caveat: Avoid Translator App Dependence!</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sure, Korean translator apps can be super helpful if you use them right.

At first, you’re only looking up words you don’t know to help you flesh out a sentence. But then you’re using it to check the accuracy of your whole sentence. And then you use it to help you create the whole sentence for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This “translator trap” is a major pitfall for language learners. It takes away the mental stimulation of&nbsp;<em>trying to remember the language on your own</em>. If you become this reliant on translators, then you may be better deleting them from your phone and sticking with a real-life dictionary — yes, I mean a physical book. If you really want to know something, you’ll have to put in the effort to flip through the book and find it. And it won’t always be handy.

Because the course not only teaches the Korean language, but also a variety of methods that are proven to help Korean learners pick up the language. The course also walks you through memorization techniques so that the words you learn in the course stick with you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"myexperienceusing90daykoreanthegood\">My Experience Using 90 Day Korean: The Good</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I started&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>, one thing immediately stood out: the way the course material is written. It’s engaging, well-paced, and best of all, it’s written with a sense of humor. It’s far from dry or boring. The author(s) also weave storytelling into the course, using it to make the grammar and vocabulary you’re learning more relatable and fun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This helped me get acquainted with an important part of the Korean language. You see, one of the things that I picked up on when learning both Japanese and Korean is that verb endings are important. Basically, the ending you attach to the verb completely changes its meaning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, in Korean, 하다 means “to do”. If I want to say “I do”, I would change it to 해요. From there:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>하고 싶어요 – “want to do”</li><li>해 보세요 – “try to do”</li><li>할 수 있어요 – “could do”</li><li>할 수 없어요 – “couldn’t do”</li></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These endings are key to learning to speak the language, but the first time I tried to learn Korean, I had a hard time finding all the most common verb endings in one place.&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;turned out to be that place.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In working through&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>, I finally had the chance to see all of these different endings in action, read well-written explanations, and do guided practice. It was exactly what I had been looking for in a Korean language resource.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each of these verb forms are introduced to you gradually as you progress through the course. And despite learning so much useful Korean grammar, the course doesn’t&nbsp;<em>feel</em>grammar intensive. Often, the grammar is masked as a culture lesson, such as when you’re taught to use formal vs informal Korean. At other times, it’s surrounded by lessons focused on vocabulary and other information so you don’t feel as though you’re learning grammar point after grammar point. The lessons are really well organized.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;has several extra features on top of the core course. This includes the option to take notes and store them directly in the course. Personally, I still prefer to take notes by hand. It helps with memory and it’s a pretty rewarding way to see everything you’ve worked on, but it’s still nice to have the option to quickly jot things down and save them for later all in one place.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":25473,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/90-day-korean-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25473\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You learn a lot of material in&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>, but as I said before, it’s organized in a way that doesn’t feel overwhelming. It also builds naturally, so everything you learn spans out from what you’ve already studied in earlier lessons.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I started&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;a little bit after I began learning Korean for a second time, so I didn’t have a lot of experience with the language.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I dedicated myself to working through the course at a slightly faster pace than what is recommended. When you sign up for the course, you are sent a new mini module each week, but if you want to work through it a little faster, they have instructions within the course about how to contact them to get “advance access” to the course materials. I took advantage of this and in total, it took me about 4 to 5 months to work through everything at an “accelerated” pace. That said, I still want to go back and spend more time with some of the lessons to make sure I really get the most out of the lesson materials.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you work through the course, you can mark what you’ve gone through as complete. This makes the course extremely versatile because you can bounce around from lesson to lesson, focusing on new material and reviewing old material however you see fit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":25471,\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://www.fluentin3months.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/90day-korean3-1024x493.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-25471\"/></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 id=\"learningkoreanwiththe8020rulemaximumresultsminimumeffort\">Learning Korean with the 80/20 Rule: Maximum Results, Minimum Effort</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>, what you learn in the course makes use of the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule). Get 80% of the results with 20% of the effort. The material presented in&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;is curated for you using this approach. You learn the 20% that will do 80% of the work for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here’s an example from the course:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Is there a past tense of -(으)세요?</p><p>“Yes, there is.

It’s not hard to wonder: “do I really need to know all of this?”&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>seeks to eliminate this feeling by eliminating the material you probably don’t need. That way, when you study, you can focus all of your attention on what’s given to you rather than allow yourself to get distracted by that lingering question in the back of your mind.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 id=\"myexperienceusing90daykoreanwhatcouldbebetter\">My Experience Using 90 Day Korean: What Could Be Better?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each of the lessons in&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;have fun titles, but when you’re working through the course in a non-linear way, this isn’t very user-friendly. For example, after completing the course, there were a couple of lessons that I wanted to go over again, but because the titles didn’t always tell me what the lesson includes, I had a difficult time finding the particular lessons I was looking for later on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While you&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;access the course from the&nbsp;<em>90 Day Korean</em>&nbsp;app, it isn’t an app version of the course.

The experience is a little different than what you might expect within an app and I found it somewhat distracting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, I found that the search function within the course didn’t really work. On a couple different occasions, I tried to find lessons using the search function, even once pasting in the exact text I had copied from a lesson.
